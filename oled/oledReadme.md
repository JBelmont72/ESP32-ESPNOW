# !!version that auto-detects the I2C bus number so it works on both ESP32 and ESP8266 without changing I2C(0, ‚Ä¶) manually.
That might prevent future ‚ÄúNo display found‚Äù headaches.
Scan both common I¬≤C buses on the ESP32 (I2C(0) and I2C(1)).
Detect the OLED‚Äôs actual I¬≤C address (0x3C or 0x3D).
Bus auto-detect ‚Üí works even if your board uses I2C(1) instead of I2C(0).
Address auto-detect ‚Üí works with both common SSD1306 addresses without editing code.
Fail-safe ‚Üí stays in an infinite loop with an error message if no display is found, so you know it‚Äôs wiring or power related.

# the OLED script auto-adjust resolution if it detects a 128√ó32 or 128√ó64 OLED.
That way you don‚Äôt need to hardcode 128, 64.

Detect the SSD1306 OLED address.
Auto-detect height ‚Üí if it can‚Äôt tell, it defaults to 64px, but you can force 32px if needed.

# why do a number of oled programs use: from machine import Pin, SoftI2C import ssd1306 import framebuf # using default address 0x3C i2c = SoftI2C(sda=Pin(22), scl=Pin(23)) display = ssd1306.SSD1306_I2C(128, 64, i2c) constructors ?

That‚Äôs because in MicroPython there are **two kinds of I¬≤C objects** you can use:

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ `I2C` (hardware I¬≤C)**

* Uses the ESP32‚Äôs built-in hardware I¬≤C peripheral.
* Very fast and efficient.
* On ESP32, it supports *any* GPIO pins (pin-muxed in software), but under the hood it still uses the hardware controller.
* The constructor looks like:

  ```python
  from machine import Pin, I2C
  i2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(22), sda=Pin(21))  # bus ID 0
  ```
* **Why use it?** ‚Üí Faster and uses less CPU.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ `SoftI2C` (bit-banged I¬≤C)**

* Implements I¬≤C in **pure software**, toggling pins manually.
* Works on *any* two GPIO pins, even if the hardware I¬≤C peripheral is busy or unavailable.
* The constructor looks like:

  ```python
  from machine import Pin, SoftI2C
  i2c = SoftI2C(sda=Pin(22), scl=Pin(23))
  ```
* **Why use it?**

  * Some boards‚Äô default hardware I¬≤C pins are already in use.
  * Hardware I¬≤C may be buggy on certain MicroPython versions or pins.
  * Easier for beginners ‚Äî no bus ID numbers, just SDA and SCL pins.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Why `framebuf` is sometimes imported**

* The `ssd1306` driver uses `framebuf` internally to store the display‚Äôs pixel data in RAM before sending it to the OLED.
* If you want to draw shapes or manipulate pixels yourself, you can call `framebuf` functions directly.
* Example:

  ```python
  import framebuf
  # draw lines, rectangles, etc.
  ```

---

## **In short**

* `I2C(...)` ‚Üí hardware, faster, bus ID required.
* `SoftI2C(...)` ‚Üí software, more flexible, slightly slower.
* Both work with the `ssd1306.SSD1306_I2C(...)` constructor.

---

If you want, I can make your OLED auto-detection script work with **either hardware I¬≤C or SoftI2C** ‚Äî so it will try hardware first, then fall back to software if needed.
That would make it *almost unbreakable* for pin changes.
