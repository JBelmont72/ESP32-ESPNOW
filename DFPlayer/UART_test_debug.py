How to test
Wire the connections:
Pico GP0 → RX of USB-UART adapter or other microcontroller
Pico GP1 → TX of the other device
GND → GND
Upload and run uart_test_debug.py on your Pico.
Open two serial ports:
USB REPL (115200 baud) — to see [DEBUG] messages.
UART terminal (9600 baud) — to watch messages arrive and type replies.
Observe what happens:
Pico prints debug info in the USB REPL (so you can confirm it’s sending).
The other device should see UART Test Message #….
If you type into the UART terminal, Pico prints [DEBUG] Received: and echoes back.

UART TEST SCRIPT — DEBUG VERSION
--------------------------------
This script is to help you learn and verify that the Pico's UART works.

Features:
- Sends a message out the UART every 2 seconds.
- Echoes back any characters received.
- Prints debug info to the USB REPL so you can see what’s happening.

Pins:
    TX = GP0  (Pico sends data out here)
    RX = GP1  (Pico listens for data here)
    GND must be shared with the other device.

Baud rate: 9600 bps (both devices must match).
