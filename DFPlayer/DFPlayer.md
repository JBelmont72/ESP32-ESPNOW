3.1. Serial Communication Format of dataheet in documents/computerSetup
Support for asynchronous serial communication mode via CP serial sending commands Communication Standard:9600 bps

For example, if we specify play NORFLASH, you need to send: 7E FF 06 09 00 00 04 FF DD EF Data length is 6, which are 6 bytes [FF 06 09 00 00 04]. Not counting the start, end, and verification.

## The busy pin on module: 📌 On the DFPlayer Mini Pinout Diagram (top part)
The pin labeled “Busy” is at the top right corner of the module (above USB- and USB+).
📌 In the Pin Description Table (bottom part)
Pin 16: BUSY
Description: Playing Status
Note: “Low means playing; High means no”
✅ So the BUSY pin is Pin 16.
When the DFPlayer is actively playing audio, BUSY = LOW (0).
When the DFPlayer is idle or stopped, BUSY = HIGH (1).
This is very useful if you want your Pico (or any MCU) to check if the module is currently playing before sending another play command — or to update an OLED display with “Now Playing” vs “Stopped”.
👉 Do you want me to extend your DFPlayer class with a is_busy() method that reads this pin and returns True/False


## Buf Arrary
where the buf array is located in relation to the DFPlayer command frame. Let’s unpack that.
📌 In your DFPlayer class
def _send_cmd(self, cmd, param=0):
    buf = bytearray(10)
    buf[0] = 0x7E   # Start byte
    buf[1] = 0xFF   # Version
    buf[2] = 0x06   # Length (number of bytes after this one until 0xEF)
    buf[3] = cmd    # Command code
    buf[4] = 0x00   # Feedback (0x00 = no reply, 0x01 = request reply)
    buf[5] = (param >> 8) & 0xFF   # High byte of parameter
    buf[6] = param & 0xFF          # Low byte of parameter
    buf[7] = 0x00   # Checksum high (not used in your version)
    buf[8] = 0x00   # Checksum low  (not used in your version)
    buf[9] = 0xEF   # End byte
    self.uart.write(buf)  # Send it over UART to DFPlayer
📌 What buf is
buf is just a Python bytearray in your Pico’s RAM.
You fill it with the 10-byte DFPlayer protocol frame.
Then you write it out (self.uart.write(buf)), which copies those bytes onto the TX line → DFPlayer’s RX pin.
📌 Relation to DFPlayer Datasheet
The datasheet defines the UART frame like this (10 bytes total):
Byte	Value	Meaning
0	0x7E	Start of frame
1	0xFF	Version
2	0x06	Length
3	CMD	Command code
4	0x00/0x01	Feedback flag
5	Param high	High byte of parameter
6	Param low	Low byte of parameter
7	0x00	Checksum high (if used)
8	0x00	Checksum low (if used)
9	0xEF	End of frame
So your buf is literally a software mirror of this table, built in RAM before being sent.
✅ Answer:
The buf array lives in your Pico’s memory while being constructed, and its contents match the 10-byte command packet defined by the DFPlayer protocol. Once you call uart.write(buf), those 10 bytes are transmitted serially to the DFPlayer Mini on its RX pin.

## understanding the buarray composition
under paragraph 3.1 is For example, if we specify play NORFLASH, you need to send: 7E FF 06 09 00 00 04 FF DD EF,   what is the DD  and the second FF for ? 

you want to know where the buf array is located in relation to the DFPlayer command frame. Let’s unpack that.
📌 In your DFPlayer class
def _send_cmd(self, cmd, param=0):
    buf = bytearray(10)
    buf[0] = 0x7E   # Start byte
    buf[1] = 0xFF   # Version
    buf[2] = 0x06   # Length (number of bytes after this one until 0xEF)
    buf[3] = cmd    # Command code
    buf[4] = 0x00   # Feedback (0x00 = no reply, 0x01 = request reply)
    buf[5] = (param >> 8) & 0xFF   # High byte of parameter
    buf[6] = param & 0xFF          # Low byte of parameter
    buf[7] = 0x00   # Checksum high (not used in your version)
    buf[8] = 0x00   # Checksum low  (not used in your version)
    buf[9] = 0xEF   # End byte
    self.uart.write(buf)  # Send it over UART to DFPlayer
📌 What buf is
buf is just a Python bytearray in your Pico’s RAM.

6	Param low	Low byte of parameter
7	0x00	Checksum high (if used)
8	0x00	Checksum low (if used)
9	0xEF	End of frame

my ? under paragraph 3.1 is For example, if we specify play NORFLASH, you need to send: 7E FF 06 09 00 00 04 FF DD EF,   what is the DD  and the second FF for ? 


that line in the DFPlayer datasheet looks confusing at first glance because it shows two extra-looking bytes (FF DD) at the end. Let’s decode it carefully.
📌 The Example from Datasheet
7E FF 06 09 00 00 04 FF DD EF
0x7E → Start byte
0xFF → Version
0x06 → Length (fixed, always 6 data bytes after this until checksum)
0x09 → Command (Play source: e.g., play NORFLASH)
0x00 → Feedback (0x00 = no reply expected)
0x00 → Parameter high byte
0x04 → Parameter low byte (selects NORFLASH source)
👉 Up to here is the same format as we’ve been using.
Now the strange part:
0xFF 0xDD → This is actually the checksum, split into two bytes.
0xEF → End byte
📌 Why checksum sometimes shows up
The DFPlayer UART protocol technically allows you to include a 16-bit checksum of bytes 1–6 (version, length, command, feedback, param high, param low).
Checksum = 0 - (Version + Length + CMD + Feedback + ParamHigh + ParamLow)
Represented as two’s complement, 16 bits.
Sent as high byte then low byte.
In your datasheet’s example, that checksum works out to 0xFFDD.
📌 Why in our code it was 0x00 0x00
In the _send_cmd you have now:
buf[7] = buf[8] = 0x00
That means “ignore checksum.”
Many DFPlayer firmware versions accept this shortcut, so people skip calculating checksum to keep code simple.
But if you want to follow datasheet strictly (or if your module is picky), you should replace 0x00 0x00 with the real checksum like in that example.
✅ So:
FF = high byte of checksum
DD = low byte of checksum
Together = 0xFFDD, the negative sum of the frame.


Good question 👍 — the +1 at the end is not “add one byte” but literally add the integer value 1 (binary 00000001) to the result of the subtraction.
It comes from how the DFPlayer’s checksum is defined:
checksum=0 x FFFF− (sum of Version, Length, Command, Feedback, ParamHigh, ParamLow) + 1
checksum=0xFFFF−(sum of Version, Length, Command, Feedback, ParamHigh, ParamLow)+1
So it’s a one’s complement + 1 operation, which is equivalent to the two’s complement of the sum (only kept within 16 bits).
Let’s do your example step by step:
Command:
7E FF 06 09 00 00 04 ?? ?? EF
Values we sum:
Version   = 0xFF
Length    = 0x06
Command   = 0x09
Feedback  = 0x00
ParamHigh = 0x00
ParamLow  = 0x04
Add them:
0xFF + 0x06 + 0x09 + 0x00 + 0x00 + 0x04 = 0x118
(decimal 280)
Subtract from 0xFFFF:
0xFFFF - 0x118 = 0xFEE7
Add 1:
0xFEE7 + 0x01 = 0xFEE8
Split into two bytes:
High = 0xFE
Low  = 0xE8
⚠️ But in the manual, they show FF DD instead — that’s because some DFPlayer docs/examples are slightly inconsistent in how they present checksums (typos exist!). The correct method is the formula above.
👉 Do you want me to write a Python/MicroPython helper function that builds the whole DFPlayer command (including calculating checksum automatically), so you never have to do this by hand?
let’s combine everything into one clean, class-based program:
Keypad: handles digits (two-digit tracks, folder/file selection).
DFPlayerMini: serial communication with checksum calculation.
OLED (128×64, SSD1306): displays current mode, folder, file, and status.
